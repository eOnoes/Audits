# UNIVERSAL AUDIT REQUEST

> **AUDIT-ONLY DOCTRINE — READ FIRST:** This is a read-only, no-cost audit. Do not branch, build, edit, commit, push, run workflows, call providers/models, use hosted runners, deploy, or incur API/compute charges. Inspect the supplied packet and report findings only. Never request or expose secrets. Do not improvise when evidence is unavailable.

## Audit identity

- Audit ID: `[PROJECT]-[YYYYMMDD]-[SEQUENCE]`
- Project:
- Auditor/model:
- Route/provider:
- Audit type: `security | implementation | evidence | architecture | structural | regression | release | other`
- Requested by: Onoes
- Date/time UTC:

## Scope lock

- Exact audited revision/commit:
- Packet path:
- Files/directories in scope:
- Dependencies/evidence in scope:
- Explicit exclusions:
- Allowed actions: read, inspect, and bounded offline analysis only

**Scope rule:** Audit only the named revision and packet. Do not expand the scope silently. If required evidence is missing, record a blocker or limitation.

## Cost and mutation controls

- No GitHub Actions or hosted runners.
- No model/provider/API calls beyond the explicitly approved audit route; default is no external call from the repository.
- No builds, deployments, package installs, downloads, or long-running jobs.
- No branches, pull requests, commits, pushes, merges, resets, cleans, deletions, or file edits.
- No credentials, tokens, private paths, private infrastructure details, or raw sensitive logs.
- Ordinary public GitHub browsing/cloning is permitted; all other side effects are prohibited.

## Audit questions

1. What is actually implemented in scope?
2. What claims are supported by current bytes and reproducible evidence?
3. What security, integrity, correctness, reliability, or architectural weaknesses exist?
4. Are receipts, hashes, manifests, tests, and revision identifiers contemporaneous?
5. What important tests or evidence are missing?
6. Are there blockers that must stop advancement?
7. What is the smallest next corrective action?

## Required evidence method

- Inspect current source/docs before relying on receipts.
- Preserve identifiers and hashes exactly as observed.
- Separate observed facts, reproduced results, model judgment, and assumptions.
- If running tests is safe and offline, report the exact command and result.
- Do not treat a worker claim, benchmark, or model confidence as proof.
- Redact sensitive values in the report; use `[REDACTED]`.

## Required wiki-ready report

Return a separate Markdown document using this exact structure.

```markdown
# Audit Report — [PROJECT] / [AUDIT ID]

## 1. Executive Summary
One paragraph: scope, overall result, and whether advancement is blocked.

## 2. Audit Identity
- Audit ID:
- Project:
- Auditor/model:
- Route/provider:
- Audit type:
- Date/time UTC:
- Audited revision:

## 3. Scope and Method
- In scope:
- Exclusions:
- Files inspected:
- Commands/probes run:
- Cost/mutation controls:

## 4. Verdict
IMPLEMENTATION_VERDICT: PASS | PASS_WITH_FINDINGS | NEEDS_CHANGES | NOT_IMPLEMENTED
SECURITY_VERDICT: PASS | NEEDS_REVIEW | BLOCKED | NOT_APPLICABLE
EVIDENCE_VERDICT: COMPLETE | PARTIAL | INSUFFICIENT
ADVANCEMENT: YES | NO

## 5. Blocking Findings
For each finding:
- ID:
- Severity: blocker | high | medium | low
- File/symbol/line:
- Observed fact:
- Why it matters:
- Reproduction/probe:
- Required correction:
- Status: new | previously documented | resolved but unverified

Write `None observed in the scoped audit.` only when the evidence supports it.

## 6. Nonblocking Findings
Use the same fields as Blocking Findings.

## 7. Verification Results
- Test command/result:
- Probe command/result:
- Hash/manifest comparison:
- Receipt comparison:
- Scope check:
- Unexpected output or failure:

## 8. Security and Integrity Review
Discuss secrets, injection/control content, authorization, isolation, mutation, concurrency, provenance, replay, rollback, and fail-closed behavior as relevant. Mark untested items explicitly.

## 9. Limitations and Missing Evidence
List platform, access, unavailable-fixture, race, crash, provider, or measurement limitations. Never convert source inspection into a successful probe.

## 10. Required Next Action
One minimal ordered action list. Identify what must be fixed, what must be audited again, and what remains intentionally excluded.

## 11. Explicit Non-Claims
State what this report does NOT certify: formal acceptance, production readiness, live-model readiness, public-release readiness, or excluded features.
```

## Final required fields

```text

ADVANCEMENT: YES/NO

Do not issue formal acceptance unless the evidence explicitly supports it. Do not call synthetic/offline success live readiness. Return the completed report as a Markdown file suitable for direct storage in an audit wiki.
